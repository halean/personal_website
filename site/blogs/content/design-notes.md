# Design Notes

This site takes cues from BBC’s visual language without copying it: a strong dark header, a red accent for emphasis, and card-based section layouts. The goal is a readable, responsive structure that works well on mobile and desktop.

## Layout

- Hero split on desktop; single column on mobile.
- Card grids that adapt from 1 → 2 → 3 columns.
- Bold navigation with a mobile menu toggle.
- Accessible semantics and alt text throughout.
- Low-JS approach with optional JSON-driven content.

Next iterations might add section rails, richer typographic hierarchy, and light/dark themes.
