# What the Birds Think of My Garden

## Summary

- Small, walled garden with food and water draws birds.
- Bathing scenes like children at a public fountain; one bold lingerer.
- Wondering what they think; perhaps, simply, they love the garden.

I sometimes wonder what the birds think of my garden. The garden is small, walled, with bits of grass, a birch tree, some evergreen. More importantly, it has food. First, I composted my leftovers, quite liberally (meat and all). Then the birds came to pick from the chicken carcasses, fish bones, worms and maggots. Then I began to feed them, with grains, cereal, whatever I can find. Then the birds saw an upside down plastic lid that was full of water, and requisite it as a bath. They would stand on the edge, took a few drinks, then jumped in. They would try the shallow part first, then gingerly test the slightly deeper part. Then they had fun. Have you watched birds bathing? Very similar to the scenes of children playing with water at some public fountain. Fun they have, splashing water all around, flicking their tails faster than the eyes can see. Then one took off, everybody else, almost everybody else, followed. That single brave/greedy one would not. It looked around a bit, then keep picking off the grains. Spring time was a time of aplenty, young leaves and all, but the birds did not prefer vegetables over carb! What do they think, a good place for food? For fun? For social? For security? Or their eyes, when flight through, captured the images, their neurons classified them as: “good”, then they landed? But really, why not believe that they love my garden?
