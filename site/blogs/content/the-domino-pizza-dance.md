# The Domino Pizza Dance

## Summary

- Sunday pizza ritual; Domino’s after Sainsbury’s counter closed.
- Watching the pizzarista’s precise, optimised “dance.”
- Reflection: as AI takes tasks, what remains is performance.

Pizza for Sunday lunch is a ritual. At first, it was why not; then it became the rule. Everyone likes it. Once a week, Minh doesn’t have to think about what to cook, his son doesn’t have to do the washing up, and after a week of healthy food, it feels almost rebellious to devour something so greasy.

Minh used to get his pizza from Sainsbury’s while shopping—efficient. But now, the pizza counter has closed. Wrong decision, but anyway. So he had to go to Domino’s.

Domino’s isn’t far from his house—just not on the way.

At Domino’s, there’s a glass window where customers can watch the pizzarista (is that a word?) at work. Minh stood watching with amazement: the hands moved gracefully, surely, the sequence finely tuned—taking the nicely risen dough from a box, spreading it out with the palms, semolina on the surface and the dough, then a few theatrical tosses to show off its elasticity. Then tomato sauce, cheese, toppings, and finally into the oven. All the movements were precise. Optimised. Yet they looked like a dance, a performance.

Is this the future? Minh wondered. We’re all putting on performances for each other.

These tasks no longer need to be done by hand—or at least, not in view of customers. But Domino’s does it in view, and Minh, watching, appreciates it.

He, too, works with his hands—of a sort. As a consultant, he does experiments for clients. But how much of his time is now spent writing reports, polishing presentations? Putting on a show, so to speak?

As machines—and now AIs—take over jobs, first agricultural, then industrial, now white-collar, perhaps what’s left, in the end, are the performances.
