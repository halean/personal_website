# Bangkok 2015 — Health Check and a Night Out

## Summary

- Trip to Bangkok for my mom’s health check.
- Airbnb apartment; cooked and ate together for the first time in a long while.
- A quiet, tired strip club visit — nothing like the imagination.
- A terrorist attack struck that night; we weighed staying versus leaving.
- One final day: river boat ride, time together, then home.

## Setting Out

Summer 2015. My son and I were visiting my parents in Phan Thiet when my mom suggested a trip to Bangkok for a health check-up. She didn’t fully trust local results and liked planning check-up trips abroad. The idea made sense: I could help with doctors, and we’d have a mini holiday.

## Apartment Life and Cooking

We stayed in a comfortable Airbnb with kitchen, living room, and a pool downstairs — even a Jacuzzi with hot and cold plunges. On arrival, I did what I always do on holiday: stocked up at Tesco. My mom was skeptical — who cooks on holiday? I did. We ate. She saw it was fine. Then she cooked too. It was probably the first time in a long while that she cooked and both her son and grandson ate it. Her other grandsons never quite took to her style of cooking.

## Hospital Visit

At the hospital, she was at ease — she’d seen me in my element with doctors and nurses before. On a previous Singapore trip, she’d been surprised when the doctor and I chatted naturally. Nothing significant came from the check-up, but she felt reassured.

## The Night Out

That night, I slipped away. Bangkok is famous for its strip clubs. My uncle described them with disdain; my father with indifference; naturally, I wanted to see for myself. I researched and knew exactly where to go.

The club was eye-opening, but not in that way. Early in the evening, customers were sparse. Everything felt tired — the dancers, the music, the bartender, even three middle-aged customers, slumped and watching with eyes that seemed to say: “I resigned — from work, from excitement, from it all.” No wild crowd, no exciting music. I bought three drinks for three random dancers — 90 Baht each, a Coke in a UK restaurant. “Where are you from?” they asked. “Japan,” I lied. Someone spoke Japanese. I had no answer. I wasn’t looking for anything more; I left soon after and didn’t try other clubs.

## The Bombing

Back at the apartment, the streets felt eerier than expected. I checked my phone — a terrorist attack had struck Bangkok that night. Now a dilemma: stay or leave. Staying risked another incident and later criticism. Leaving early meant abandoning the apartment — defeat. We compromised: one more day, then home.

## The Day After

We took a river boat. The boatman, cautious but proud, seemed to say that no matter what happens, the boat must go on. The scenery wasn’t so different from Vietnam, but my mom and my son enjoyed it and even spotted crocodiles.

## Reflections

Then we returned to Vietnam, wrapping up what I hoped was a memorable trip for my mom and my son — reassurance in the hospital, a shared table at home away from home, and a strange, quiet night where a city held its breath.
