<p>Welcome! This is a small, BBC‑inspired personal site built to be fast, responsive, and hostable on GitHub Pages. The goal is to keep things simple and readable while hinting at the familiar layout patterns of a large news site.</p>
<p>From here, we’ll iterate: more posts, theming, and maybe a light CMS in the future. For now, it’s all static HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript for the navigation menu.</p>
