## Arrival

It was a crisp December morning when Minh arrived at his son’s primary school for the annual nativity play. The children’s chatter filled the air, and the faint scent of pine from the stage decorations lingered. Minh scanned the program, noting the traditional roles: Mary, Joseph, shepherds, wise men. But the roll call was anything but traditional. 

## Casting announcement

The teacher stepped forward with a beaming smile and began, “Playing Joseph, we have Mohamed!” A ripple of applause followed, with proud parents nodding approvingly. “And playing Mary, Shahela!” Minh couldn’t help but chuckle under his breath. He leaned over to another parent and whispered, “Only in here could Mohamed and Shahela bring the story of Bethlehem to life.” The parent grinned back, sharing the sentiment. As the audience clapped and cheered, Minh glanced at the parents around him. Some, he imagined, might have grown up in homes where celebrating a nativity play was alienated. Yet here they were, applauding their children. Minh thought about their thoughts, then moved on.

## Performance

As the play unfolded, the children—Syrians, Kurds, Afghans, Estonians, and Lithuanians, alongside a sprinkling of English classmates—performed with joyful abandon. The accents, names, and backgrounds blurred into a single, harmonious celebration of the nativity story. To the children, it was about the joy of dressing up, singing carols, and cradling a plastic baby Jesus. To Minh, it was something far more emotional. One had to be there to feel the effortless normalcy of it all. Mohamed and Shahela played their parts with earnestness and charm, and the audience cheered with equal enthusiasm.

## Beyond the hall

Minh thought of the world beyond this little school hall—a world where names like Mohamed and Shahela could spark division, even violence. Here, they brought nothing but smiles. As the play reached its final scene, with Mohamed and Shahela standing proudly at the manger, Minh felt a lump rise in his throat. The children’s innocence, the parents’ pride, the sheer ordinariness of the moment—it all felt extraordinary. In this little corner of the world, the nativity story had transcended its origins to become something universal, something for everyone.

## Walking home

Walking home later, Minh reflected on the beauty of it all. Yet frustration bubbled beneath the surface. All he read in the newspapers was violence, divides, and the insistence that everything was worse than before. But here, in this little school hall, he had witnessed something extraordinary. Why didn’t others see it? Why did no one write about these moments of humanity? He thought about his son’s classmates: the Syrian boy who was quiet and calm, the Kurdish girl, the biggest in class, strong and imposing, the Nigerian boy who ran the fastest, the Libyan boy, fresh from a war-torn country, the Lithuanian girl with her deep blue eyes, and her childlike affection to Sayfullah, a boy of Russian-Chechen heritage, His son's best friends, Admed, a Sudanese, and Mustafa, a Kashmiri. They carried names, histories, and identities. But here, in school, they were just children—playing, learning, and growing, together. For Minh, the roll call stayed: “Playing Joseph, we have Mohamed! And playing Mary, Shahela!” A simple announcement, stating the facts, yet one that captured the hope for the future.

## Extra sentiment

The Nativity Play happened in about 2016. The children were mostly 9 year olds, in their year 3. A war was still going on in Libya. Syria was (and still is, for that matter) a very unstable place. Kurdistan was not (and still is not) a country. Skirmishes still happened in Kashmir. The teachers probably chose Mohamed and Shahela because they were good readers, or enthusiastic participants, or simply because they raised their hands. They would not spare a thought about anything else. Minh thought about his father and uncles, who had dreamt of a society where "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" could become a reality. They had fought for it, yet their dreams had remained far away. Minh, however, had stumbled upon it—not perfectly, but in the education and health care his son and his son’s friends now received. These children were living proof.
