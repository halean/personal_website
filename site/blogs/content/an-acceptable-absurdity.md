# An Acceptable Absurdity

## Summary

- A man leaves a supermarket with a six‑pack as guards call “Stop!” from a distance.
- He opens a can in an empty bay; the guards hover, one calls the police.
- Shoppers glance and move on; the system absorbs the loss.
- Minh reflects on duty, risk, and the limits of rules.
- Police arrive; the world keeps turning.

## Cold wind, quick glance

The wind cut through the parking lot like a blade, a reminder that 5°C was no weather for lingering. Minh was running, with just a jumper on, when a commotion near the supermarket entrance caught his attention.

## The walk‑out

A man, walking briskly but not quite running, emerged with a six-pack of beer cradled in his arm. Behind him, two security guards followed, their steps deliberate, their voices raised but not panicked. “Stop! Stop! Stop!” they called, in a rhythm that felt almost rehearsed, like a chant in a strange performance. Yet their actions betrayed their words—they maintained a cautious two-meter distance, as if an invisible line separated their duty from their safety.

## The stage in an empty bay

The man didn’t flinch. He didn’t look back, either. He simply walked to the edge of the lot, where an empty parking space waited like a stage. There, he set the six-pack on the asphalt, cracked open a can, and took a long sip, as if to toast the absurdity of the moment.

## Hesitation and protocol

Minh watched as the security guards hesitated, their earlier shouts fading into a quiet debate. One pulled out a phone, presumably to call the police, while the other lingered, his hands half-raised in a gesture that seemed to say, “What now?”

## The slow‑motion dance

The scene unfolded like a slow-motion dance—the man, unhurried, sipping his beer; the guards, frozen between protocol and practicality; the shoppers, glancing briefly before continuing on with their lives. It was as if the world had collectively decided that this was an acceptable absurdity, a disruption too small to derail the larger rhythm of the day.

## Calculus of risk

Minh’s thoughts wandered. The security guards were just doing their job, balancing their obligation to act against their instinct for self-preservation. After all, what if the man lashed out? A six-pack wasn’t worth an injury. The man, for his part, seemed resigned rather than triumphant. Whatever circumstances had brought him here, they had distilled into this moment: “I need my beer. What can they really do to me?”

## Systems and blind spots

And society? It moved on, as it always did. The supermarket could absorb the loss, just another number in its inventory shrinkage report. The police, if they even arrived, likely had more pressing matters to attend to. Minh imagined the officer’s reaction: a sigh, perhaps, or a shake of the head as they added the incident to an endless list of small infractions.

## The hiss and the smile

The man’s second can hissed open, the sound cutting through the stillness. Minh found himself smiling, not out of amusement but out of a quiet recognition of the moment’s complexity. Here, in this cold parking lot, was a mini version of the world: rules and their limits, people and their choices, systems and their blind spots. It wasn’t heroic or tragic. It simply was.

## Lights in the gray

The police car arrived ten minutes later, its lights flashing in the gray afternoon. By then, the man had finished half the six-pack. He raised one of the remaining cans in a mock salute as the officers approached, their steps purposeful but not hurried. Minh turned away, tucking his thermos into his bag. There was nothing more to see. The world would keep turning, just as it always did.
