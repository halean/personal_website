- Reflection on how fast normal changes for a child born in safety.
- A private version about “expansive” green eyes and an air of authenticity.

## A box of strawberries

Sayfullah, Minh’s son’s friend, once shared a box of strawberries with Minh and his son (probably in 2018). He explained that he had picked them during a family outing to a strawberry farm. They had paid five pounds each to enter, eat as many strawberries as they liked, and then paid separately for the ones they took home. To Sayfullah, the outing was simple, joyful, a good experience overall.

## A past in contrast

This stirred a very strange sensation on the back of Minh’s neck, almost like fear. He thought about the likely contrast with Sayfullah’s parents’ very recent past. She Russian, he Chechen, Sayfullah’s parents had fled Chechnya to the UK during the Second Chechen War. The Chechen war had begun in 1999, and by 2003, Sayfullah’s parents had found refuge in the UK. By 2009, Sayfullah, whose name means "Sword of God" in Arabic, was born in this new land and grew up utterly normal—just like a boy named Michael, whose name means "Who is like God?", would.

## From labour to leisure

Before that, his parents had likely worked in fields, being paid to pick strawberries and other fruits. Now, paying to pick them felt perfectly normal to Sayfullah. Minh imagined Sayfullah’s parents agreeing to the trip after some nagging from their children, thinking, “Oh well, for a change, let’s see how it feels to pay to pick strawberries, instead of being paid to pick them!” Minh wondered if they hesitated, whether to share the harsh realities of their past or to simply ensure Sayfullah could experience it as something utterly ordinary—even if, to them, it was anything but.

## Casualness and change

What struck Minh most was the casualness of it all. How fast could things change? Sayfullah’s parents may still carry worries shaped by their past, but Sayfullah? His concerns were the same as any boy his age: family outings, sharing food with friends, and even girls.

## Private version

Minh's private version: What struck Minh most was the casualness of it all. How fast could things change? Sayfullah’s parents may still carry worries shaped by their past, but Sayfullah? His concerns were of a completely different nature—too many girls chasing him, his tall frame, his expansive green eyes, and an air of authenticity that set him apart. Minh recalled how he and his son coined that phrase. Minh had suggested 'deep green eyes,' but his son countered, saying deep worked for blue, evoking the sea. When Minh offered the jungle as an image, his son dismissed it: 'Not deep.' So Minh settled on expansive, capturing the vastness of a jungle or an open landscape—a fitting choice for someone like Sayfullah.
